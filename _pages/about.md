I am a master's student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen. I have the privilege of being advised by Prof. <a href="https://cuiyungao.github.io/">Cuiyun Gao</a>. I received my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen. My research interests primarily focus on Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE).
